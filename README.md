# Calcliator

Calcliator is a simple calculator application that uses `mathjs` for evaluating arithmetic
expressions. I chose the name because I called calculators 'calcliators' when I was a toddler.
The intended purpose of this project is to help me practice unit and end-to-end testing with
Angular (as well as basic Angular development). Happy calcliating!

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 15.0.4.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Testing
