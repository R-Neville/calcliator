<p>
  Calcliator is a simple calculator application that I've created to practice Angular
  development with unit and end-to-end testing. I called calculators 'calcliators' when
  I was a toddler - hence the name.
</p>
<p>
  It uses <code>mathjs</code> for arithmetic expression evaluation.

  Happy calcliating!
